      <h3>What is New Media Art?</h3>
      <p>
  In many senses, new media art is subjective in its meaning. However, despite this subjectivity it can be viewed through a more literal definition; “new media art” or the usage of modern mediums to create contemporary expressions of art. The definition of art itself is fairly arbitrary, meaning that art can be whatever one perceives it to be. Unlike classical forms of artistic expression, new media art typically utilizes modern technologies that allows its audience to be more involved and submersed in the artist’s conceptual process, rather than just viewing the art and unable to interact with it. The three artists that I feel represent new media art well are Paul Kos, Stephen Cheng, and James Turrell. All three of these artists demonstrate various qualities, such as the usage of modern technologies that render art and the inclusion of their audience to be a part of the artistic process, that are indicative of the meaning of new media art.</p>
  <p>Paul Kos is perceived as a conceptual artist, meaning that his artwork is in correspondence to thoughts or a mental concept, rather than a physical concept that one might replicate in their artwork. In my opinion, I believe Paul Kos is representative of the “new media” art period because he uses a variety of mediums that are original, in comparison to the typical art mediums of paint and pencil. For example, Kos made an installation where the “art” is derived from sound rather than visual. He was able to achieve this by the usage of several microphones and relatively modern technology in order to make the intangible sound waves the work of art. By utilizing these modern technologies Paul Kos’s artwork becomes representative of the new media art form that has become recently realized by many audiences. In Paul Kos’s art work “The Sound of Melting Ice”, I find it fascinating how the sound of ice becomes the work of art rather than the ice itself. Many times in the past, artists will use ice to create a sculpture of sorts. Yet in Paul Kos’s work, the audience's focus is drawn to other characteristics and properties of the ice, other than it’s visual qualities. In my own art, I hope to use similar subversive qualities; decreasing the focus of one’s visual senses and honing into other qualities of an object that may even be more interesting than just its visualization. Contextually, Paul Kos exhibits that art can take more forms than that which the eye perceives. New media art proves that art is fluid and can overcome barriers and restrictions. </p>
<p>Another artist I believe is representative of new media art is Stephan Cheng, the creator of the “Empty Gallery” in Hong Kong, China. With this gallery, Cheng strives to show the viewer that there can be meaning within intangible and non materialistic objects and artwork. In Cheng’s exhibition he attempts to disorient his audience by allowing them to pass through pitch black hallways, influencing them to heighten their senses and have a more surreal experience of the “empty gallery”. Within the gallery there are many featured artworks that include video and image projection. This usage of light projection is fairly common amongst new media artists, making it a representative element of this art form in Cheng’s gallery. His gallery is also extremely immersive, which also seems to be a characteristic of new media art pieces. This particular immersive element of new media art, that Cheng’s gallery prominently displays, is one I find to give the audience a more meaningful and contextual experience when viewing the art. For that reason, this element is one I hope to incorporate in my own new media works of art. I want to create art that is inclusive and has personal context to those viewing it.</p>    
<p>The final artist that is representative of new media art is James Turrell. In all of Turrell’s works of art, he uses light and space to create a composition—drawing the majority of the viewer's attention to the hue of his display. Throughout his works he also uses light to create the illusion of three dimensional objects and planes, such as geometric shapes. When viewing his work, it appears as though Turrell is creating a painting using light as his medium, rather than paint. James Turrell’s works of art are also nonsubjective, unlike many artists who tend to use a subject matter or a focal point. In his exhibitions, Turrell makes the spectators overwhelmed and enchanted with the color and dimension alone, allowing them to construct their experience using their own personal context and the extent to which they interact with the exhibition. Thus, his exhibitions are extremely interactive because it is almost as though the spectator becomes apart of the piece of art and everyone’s experience is influenced by oneself, as well as those around.</p>   
<p>Paul Kos, Stephan Cheng and James Turrell are all artists whose work is representative of the definition of new media art. Their art forms create expression through modern mediums and are interactive with those viewing their exhibitions. Throughout the discovery process of their works, these three artists have given me a sense of context about the new media world. In addition, by navigating these three artist’s artwork, it has shown me that new media art can take various forms and can be a diverse genre.
